# US-Hierarchical-Clustering

This is a hierarchical clustering analysis of regions in the U.S. at the state level. There is debate over which region some states belong to so I was wondering what a clustering algorithm would "say". This analysis in particular uses the UPGMA method (unweighted average linkage clustering)
